Inspired by AngularJS's `ng-pattern`, `required` etc., EasyForm makes field validation with just an xml and *easy*.
You set error properties and message in xml and EasyForm will show error message when it is needed. Optinally, a button can be disabled when there is an error and enabled when all fields have valid inputs.

### Disclaimer
> This project is still with minimal features and not yet published in the jcenter. 
> I am very happy to accept any feature requests, bug reports. Please feel free to open Issues and I will try my best to prioritize it. I really like to ask for any additional feature ideas since I cannot see all use cases from any product domains. 

I will work on publishing this into jcenter but timeline cannot be determined at this point.
In a meantime, please copy my code and refer or use them.
